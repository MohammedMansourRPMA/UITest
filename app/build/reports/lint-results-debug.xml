        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute `android:fullBackupContent` to specify an `@xml` resource which configures which files to backup, or just set `android:fullBackupOnly=true`. More info: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup"

        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts the application out of being backed up and so users can&apos;t restore data related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.&#xA;&#xA;Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application. Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` or `android:fullBackupOnly` to configure auto backup."

For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the `AUTOFILL_HINT_` constants in the `View` reference at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.&#xA;&#xA;You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an `importantForAutofill` attribute on that view or a parent view.
